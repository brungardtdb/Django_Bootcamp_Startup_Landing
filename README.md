# Django_Bootcamp_Startup_Landing
A landing page for a fake startup. A a capstone project to test HTML and CSS knowledge in the Django bootcamp I'm a part of.

No specific type of startup was specified in the instructions so of course I made up something absolutely ridiculous. 
I used hipster-ipsum (https://hipsum.co/) filler text to keep things fun.
